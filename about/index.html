      <p>
        i'm siddhi/sidharth/sidharthify, i occasionally ship roms, write bash scripts and live in the UNIX terminal.
        i’m maintaining devices for roms like <a href="https://github.com/yaap">yaap</a> and <a href="https://cipheros.org.in">cipheros</a>, learning some cpp,
        and running nixos with a small homelab.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:.75rem">
        i like rock, as you may have already guessed. my favorite band is Pink Floyd. i also like IDM/EDM and any sort of experimental music as well as some j-pop.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:.75rem"> i'm a huge advocate for open-source. i believe Linux is one of the most important projects in the history of computers and that 
        we should focus on building free software for everyone.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:.75rem"> i really like AOSP, i maintain ROMs and study AOSP almost every week.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:.75rem"> i also seem to be a lot into philosophy. i like reasoning and thinking just for the fun of it. i like thinking about morality, consciousness,
        life, the universe and religion.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:.75rem"> i love computers. i had always been into them ever since i was a kid. i was fascinated by operating systems, 
        custom ROMs, kernels and low level code.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:.75rem"> i believe kindness and empathy are some of the best traits a human being can have, along with self respect and dignity.</p>

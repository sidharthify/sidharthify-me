      <p>My first time dealing with AIDL (and contributing to Lineage in the meantime).</p>

      <p>
        So recently I got a bit interested in wanting to learn about some more Android internals and I
        thought a good way of doing that would be contributing to an AOSP ROM.
        I specifically wanted to do something with HALs (Hardware Abstraction Layers) as those are
        extremely crucial for communicating with hardware in Android. My first thought
        was to find something that was either broken or needed an update/improvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        I came across the repo <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_lineage_interfaces"
          class="blog-link" </a>hardware/lineage/interfaces</a> where a lot of Open Source community built
        HALs lie. The first thing I noticed was that a lot of these HALs were still using the old HIDL
        (Hardware Interface Definition Language) implementation instead of the newly adopted
        AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I specifically got interested in the PowerShare (reverse wireless charging) implementation
        (because it was smaller and easier to interpret), I wanted to rewrite this HAL into AIDL but
        honestly during that time had
        no idea how I'd do that. But first I looked into the code and looked at the cpp implementation
        <code>Powershare.cpp</code> and tried to understand whats going on.
      </p>
      <pre data-filename="PowerShare.cpp"><code class="language-cpp">Return &lt;bool&gt; PowerShare::isEnabled() {
std::string value;

if (!ReadFileToString(POWERSHARE_PATH, &value)) {
LOG(ERROR) << "Failed to read current powershare value";
return false;
}

value = android::base::Trim(value);

return value == POWERSHARE_ENABLED;
}

Return&lt;bool&gt; PowerShare::setEnabled(bool enable) {
const auto& value = enable ? POWERSHARE_ENABLED : POWERSHARE_DISABLED;
WriteStringToFile(value, POWERSHARE_PATH, true);
return isEnabled();
}
</code></pre>
      <p> This was the main implementation, it's pretty simple, I'm sure if you're reading this, you have
        already understood
        whats going on. But if you haven't, let me explain,
      </p>
      <p>
        This basically writes <code>1</code> - <code>POWERSHARE_ENABLED</code> or <code>0</code> -
        <code>(POWERSHARE_DISABLED)</code> to a path <code>(POWERSHARE_PATH)</code>. This path
        is different for every device
        and needs to be explicitly defined in a makefile, for my Pixel 7, the path is
        <code>/sys/class/power_supply/wireless/device/rtx</code>.
      </p>
      <p> When <code>1</code> is written to that path, it enables the PowerShare function. Most of this is
        taken care of by the kernel, this HAL is basically just a toggle for the kernel.</p>
      <p>
        Now, the only thing I had to do was convert this HAL to AIDL. There were two other files as
        well, <code>service.cpp</code> which would register the HAL and the header <code>Powershare.h</code> that
        defined
        all the functions, those needed to be rewritten to a certain degree as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a bit of diging up documentations and being code reviewed, I came up with this:
      </p>
      <pre data-filename="PowerShare.cpp"><code class="language-cpp">ndk::ScopedAStatus PowerShare::isEnabled(bool* _aidl_return) {
std::string value;
if (!ReadFileToString(POWERSHARE_PATH, &value)) {
LOG(ERROR) << "Failed to read current PowerShare state";

return ndk::ScopedAStatus::fromExceptionCode(EX_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION);
}

*_aidl_return = Trim(value) == POWERSHARE_ENABLED;
return ndk::ScopedAStatus::ok();
}

ndk::ScopedAStatus PowerShare::setEnabled(bool enable) {
std::string value = enable ? POWERSHARE_ENABLED : POWERSHARE_DISABLED;
if (!WriteStringToFile(value, POWERSHARE_PATH, true)) {
LOG(ERROR) << "Failed to write PowerShare state";
return ndk::ScopedAStatus::fromExceptionCode(EX_SERVICE_SPECIFIC);
}
return ndk::ScopedAStatus::ok();
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        The logic stays the same, but the syntax and format has changed. The other files had to be
        changed accordingly:
      </p>
      <h1> Powershare.h </h1>
      <pre data-filename="PowerShare.h"><code class="language-cpp">// HIDL 
class PowerShare : public IPowerShare {
public:
Return&lt;bool&gt; isEnabled() override;
Return&lt;bool&gt; setEnabled(bool enable) override;
Return&lt;uint32_t&gt;getMinBattery() override;
Return&lt;uint32_t&gt; setMinBattery(uint32_t minBattery) override;
};
</code></pre>
      <pre data-filename="PowerShare.h"><code class="language-cpp">// AIDL
class PowerShare : public BnPowerShare {
public:
ndk::ScopedAStatus isEnabled(bool* _aidl_return) override;
ndk::ScopedAStatus setEnabled(bool enable) override;

// Unused stubs
ndk::ScopedAStatus getMinBattery(int32_t* _aidl_return) override;
ndk::ScopedAStatus setMinBattery(int32_t minBattery) override;
};
</code></pre>
      <p><code>setMinBattery()</code> is now <code>int32_t</code> and <code>getMinBattery()</code> is now
        <code>int32_t*</code> instead of being void.
        <code>isEnabled()</code> is also a boolean now instead of being void.
      </p>
      <h1> service.cpp </h1>
      <pre data-filename="service.cpp"><code class="language-cpp">// HIDL
int main() {
sp&lt;IPowerShare&gt; powerShareService = new PowerShare();

configureRpcThreadpool(1, true /*callerWillJoin*/);

if (powerShareService->registerAsService() != android::OK) {
LOG(ERROR) << "Can't register PowerShare HAL service";
return 1;
}

joinRpcThreadpool();

return 0; // should never get here
}
</code></pre>
      <pre data-filename="service.cpp"><code class="language-cpp">// AIDL 
int main() {
ABinderProcess_setThreadPoolMaxThreadCount(0);
std::shared_ptr&lt;IPowerShare&gt; powershare = ndk::SharedRefBase::make&lt;IPowerShare&gt;();

const std::string instance = std::string(PowerShare::descriptor) + "/default";
binder_status_t status =
AServiceManager_addService(powershare->asBinder().get(), instance.c_str());
CHECK_EQ(status, STATUS_OK);

ABinderProcess_joinThreadPool();
return EXIT_FAILURE;  // should not reach
}</code></pre>
      <p> This, in my opinion, has changed the most. Before it would just register the service on its own,
        but now we can do it ourselves and give it a proper descriptor.</p>
      <p> You can take a look at how the format has changed. One benefit that AIDL has over HIDL
        is that developers can control the code all they want and are not restricted in pre-defined
        definitions.
      </p>
      <p> This is only the 'backend' of the PowerShare service, there were a few changes needed from the
        Java (UI) side of things. Specifically in the <code>PowerShareTile.java</code> file
        that defines the PowerShare tile. Then there was sepolicy. But I feel like talking about those
        things would be useless, since this blog was specifically aimed at the HAL.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you ARE interested in whatever changes I've done, take a look here: <a
          href="https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:%22powershare-aidl%22" class="blog-link" </a>powershare-aidl</a>
      </p>
      </ul>
      <p> Well, thats it for this blog, I know its kinda boring and doesn't have much info, but I'll try
        going more in depth about what
        I do for the next time, this is my first ever blog, and it just makes me a bit nervous. Either
        way, I had a lot of fun writing
        the AIDL service and it genuinely taught me a lot of things (as well as making this website and
        writing this blog)

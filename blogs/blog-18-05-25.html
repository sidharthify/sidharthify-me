                <p class="description">How I got into Android ROM development and Linux</p>
                    <p>
                    In my last blog, I talked about how I programmed an AIDL implementation of the PowerShare HAL in and got
                    it merged into LineageOS. But this time, I wanna go back. I know barely anyone's reading this, but maybe
                    someone will in the future, or the near future, or never! Nevertheless, I kinda just wanna talk about it,
                    so lets begin. </p>

                    <p>
                    I got into Linux way before I flashed a custom ROM for the first time. My first Linux distro was... you guessed it,
                    Ubuntu. But something thats poetic to me is that when I was really small, my dad used to have a laptop which ran
                    Ubuntu, so technically, my first ever Operating System was Ubuntu Linux, lol.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Anyways, people usually have reasons for doing things, I didn't. I genuinely was just... curious. So I flashed Ubuntu
                    on my laptop which was an ASUS TUF FX505DY, with a Radeon RX 560x GPU, and a Ryzen 5 3550H CPU which had a Vega 8 iGPU. 
                    I miss this laptop a lot, because it was such a perfect little thing for Linux, it had zero issues running it, maybe one
                    or two bugs here and there, but it was still SO good at running any flavour of Linux I tried on it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Either way, the first time I installed Linux was without watching any video, any guide, and I just did NOT have any idea what
                    I was doing. I thought you could run windows executables (.exes) on Linux at the time. So when my usual programs didn't install,
                    I ragequit, lol. I didn't know wine existed, so I thought that Linux just had zero support.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    My Linux journey from here was on a bit of a pause then. Until in 2021, I flashed a custom ROM on my realme 8i (RMX3151 aka spaced).
                    I had flashed ROMs in the past, but this device had a very very niche community and it didn't have an official method of unlocking 
                    the bootloader, we used a thing called 'MTKClient' and used that to boot the phone into BROM mode and then unlock its bootloader, and wipe
                    the data manually.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This was.. lets just say, hard for me to do at the time. I only knew how to 'fastboot flashing unlock' and not 'python mtk da seccfg unlock'
                    Getting MTKClient set up was just a bit hard for me, I guess, I don't exactly remember, lol.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    But dealing with MTKClient and this device overall made me really really curious and interested. I didn't really do anything at the time, but 
                    I always had an itch to learn about how Android ROM development worked, or how Android itself worked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Ever since I was a kid, maybe five to six years old, I would want to root my phone. I know it sounds weird. But I had always tried
                    to root my phone even as a toddler, I didn't even comprehend what 'rooting' fully meant, but I wanted to do it, maybe to just see
                    what was possible with it or to install Shadow Fight 2 hacks, lol. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                    Anyways, I was into flashing ROMs and recoveries by this point, like, really into it. But now I also started using Fedora Linux. I got
                    in touch with the Linux community, I finally learnt basic Linux commands, I learnt what package managers are, what the kernel is, and what not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Soon enough, I started installing all types of distributions of Linux; Arch, Mint, NixOS, Nobara, Debian, etc.
                    I fell in LOVE with the kernel. All I could think about all day is 'how?', I wanted to know more, about Linux, Android, everything. 
                    I used to feel really fullfilled when I would deal with custom ROMs or Linux. I would sit until 3AM doing something nerdy and would not
                    talk to people for days.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    A friend of mine on Telegram (genuinely forgot his name, sorry) taught me how to compile a recovery image from a recovery tree and source.
                    I did this locally on my ASUS (yes, the 8GB RAM and R5 3550H one) and I LOVED doing it. I know that sounds weird, but seeing soong compile
                    the image was just soothing to me. And from this point, I learnt Git, software development processes, C, Python, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I maintained ROMs for realme 8i and realme 9 5G Speed Edition, which taught me more things than I thought they would. Even in real life, whenever
                    I would feel lost or something, I'd always come back to Telegram and get in touch with the community and do more than what I did last time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Recently, I've been able to boot custom recoveries and AOSP on the Nothing Phone 2a with my buddy Witcher. I also maintain YAAP for the Pixel 7 series 
                    (except 7a) now. I consider myself an intermediate at this stuff now. I try to learn more about programming and AOSP internals everyday, so, if you've got
                    something, hook me up!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I hope you liked reading this 'backstory', I know it's really small and nothing too exciting, but I thought I'd write something today, so I did, lol.
